# Level 5 of the differential suite: run whole C programs two ways and compare
# what they return.
#
#   oracle  : ccomp -interp  (CompCert's own reference interpreter), falling back
#             to the host C compiler for programs it cannot execute.  Each result
#             says which oracle was used.  The fallback is only sound because the
#             corpus is written to be free of undefined and
#             implementation-defined behaviour — a native compiler will happily
#             run programs whose behaviour CompCert leaves undefined.
#   subject : clightgen -lean, then the Lean interpreter (CCLib.ClightExec)
#
# IMPORTANT about what this does and does not check.  `ccomp -interp` executes
# **CompCert C** (`Csem`), not Clight — CompCert has no executable Clight
# semantics.  So this compares the *observable result* of a whole program, not
# step-by-step Clight behaviour, and it is only meaningful for programs with no
# undefined behaviour.  The step counts are deliberately not compared: the two
# semantics work at different granularities.
#
# Requirements: ccomp and clightgen built (see diff_all.sh), lean on PATH.
# Exit status 0 iff every program agrees.
