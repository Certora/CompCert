  Non-vacuity checks for the Phase-7.1 memory lemma library
  (`CCLib/MemoryLemmas.lean`).

  Every lemma there is proved, so it is *true*.  That is not the same as being
  *useful*: if `store` never succeeded, `load_store_same` would hold vacuously and
  the separation logic built on it would be worthless.  So each headline lemma is
  instantiated here at a concrete memory and the conclusion is computed.

  Everything is discharged by `decide`, not `native_decide` — the Lean memory
  model reduces in the kernel, so these checks add no axioms at all.  (Rocq
  cannot run the same checks: `Mem.store`/`load` are not evaluable there, because
  `range_perm_dec` recurses on an opaque accessibility proof.)

/-! ## The heap algebra, and the frame property end to end (Phase 7.2)

The point of `Heap`/`Agrees` is that a fragment disjoint from a write keeps
agreeing with memory afterwards — that is what the frame rule will be built from.
Here it is exercised on concrete data: a fragment owning bytes 0-3 survives a
store at offset 4. -/

/-! ## The assertion layer (Phase 7.3)

A weaker check than the ones above, and deliberately so: it establishes that
`mapsto` and `arrayU32` are *satisfiable* — ruling out the vacuous-predicate
failure mode — but does not pair a fragment with a concrete `Agrees`.  Building a
hand-rolled heap and proving it equals the singleton chain `mapsto` unfolds to
costs a great deal for little extra assurance, and Phase 7.7 exercises the whole
path for real when `is_sorted` is re-proved: the program itself constructs exactly
such a state. -/
