  Usability check for the Phase-9 Step-10 temporary-state layer
  (`CCLib.Temps`).

  The claim being tested is not "the proofs got shorter" (they did, by ~19 % on
  `ZAdler32`) but the *asymptotic* one: a statement's proof obligation is now
  **O(1) in the number of tracked temporaries** instead of O(N).  So the check is
  a `Sset` step over a deliberately long tracked list, discharged by exactly the
  same two one-liners as a step over a two-entry list.  If the cost were still
  per-temporary, this file would grow with the list; it does not.

  It also pins the thing that made it possible: `temps_ne` is kernel `decide`,
  which works only because `identOfString` reduces (see `CCLib.Positive`).  If
  that regresses, this file fails rather than silently falling back.

  The second half of the file covers `localst_fwd`, which extends the same claim
  from a single step to a **chain** of them: the mid-conditions are computed by
  `setLocal` rather than written out, so an N-assignment chain costs N `EvalExpr`
  obligations and no tracked lists at all.

/-! ## `localst_fwd`: the mid-conditions are computed, not written

The Step-10 layer made a single step O(1) in the number of tracked temporaries.
What it did *not* do was make a **chain** of steps cheap: `triple_seq_fwd` takes
its mid-condition explicitly, so an N-assignment chain cost N tracked lists
written out by hand.  `ZAdlerLoop.work_step` measured that at 117 of 356 lines.

`localst_fwd` (`CCLib.Temps`) closes it: `setLocal` computes the post-state, so
`triple_set_local`'s `hsub`/`hne` become theorems and a chain leaves exactly one
goal per assignment — its `EvalExpr` obligation, the only part that is not
bookkeeping.  It cut `work_step` from 117 lines to 57.

The checks below pin the three things that can regress. -/

/-- **A four-assignment chain, with no tracked list written anywhere.**  Contrast
    the twenty-temporary `Sset` example above, which needed the list once; a chain
    used to need it once *per assignment*.  Here the postcondition is stated as the
    `setLocal` chain the tactic computes, so the values are inferred too. -/

/-- **Reading a temporary back out of a chain**, which is what `temps_get` exists
    for.  `temps_mem` alone cannot do it: `simp` turns the membership into a
    disjunction of pairwise equalities and stalls, because the tracked *values*
    carry free variables so `decide` refuses the goal.  `temps_get` peels the chain
    with `mem_setLocal_of_mem'` instead, which puts two bare identifiers in front
    of `decide` and leaves the values alone. -/
